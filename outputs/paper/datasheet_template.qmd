Extract of the questions from @gebru2021datasheets.


**Motivation**

1. *For what purpose was the dataset created? Was there a specific task in mind? Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled? Please provide a description.*
    - The dataset was created to complement the ability of the federal statistical system to respond and provide relavant information about how emergent issues are impacting American households (National Center for Health Statistics, 2024). 
2. *Who created the dataset (for example, which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (for example, company, institution, organization)?*
    - Data was provided by NCHS/DHIS and the owner of the dataset is NCHS.
3. *Who funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an associated grant, please provide the name of the grantor and the grant name and number.*
    - Although there was not significant information specified about the funding, generally in addition to annual appropriations from Congress, NCHS receives additional resources in the form of reimbursables from other Federal agencies. NCHS is reimbursed by other agencies to add specific questions of interest to our surveys (National Center for Health Statistics, 2023). 
4. *Any other comments?*
    - Survey datas that are open to public is scarce and often not open to public. However, regarding health statistics for US research, NCHS is a good place to start with.

**Composition**

1. *What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (for example, documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple types of instances (for example, movies, users, and ratings; people and interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description.*
	- Online questionnaire based survey with texts only.
2. *How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?*
	- Just a single survey questionnaire.
3. *Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger set (for example, geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (for example, to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).*
	- The dataset contain all possible instances, and yet considered a sample of instances from a larger set as it is still missing some responses from the whole population. The larger set would be a survey response from the whole population in US. The representativeness was verified as the hosting institution is the government associated. 
4. *What data does each instance consist of? "Raw" data (for example, unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please provide a description.*
	- Raw data is nicely formatted in CSV form. Data types are among the following : 'Text', 'Floating Timestamp', and 'Number.' 
5. *Is there a label or target associated with each instance? If so, please provide a description.*
	- Columns in this Dataset. (1) Indicator - Data Type [Text] (2) Group - Data Type [Text] (3) State - Data Type [Text] (4) Subgroup - Data Type [Text] (5) Phase - Data Type [Text] (6) Time Period - Data Type [Text] (7) Time Period Label - Data Type [Text] (8) Time Period Start Date - Data Type [Floating Timestamp] (9) Time Period End Date - Data Type [Floating Timestamp] (10) Value - Data Type [Number] (11) Low CI - Data Type [Number] (12) High CI - Data Type [Number] (13) Confidence Interval - Data Type [Text] (14) Quartile Range - Data Type [Text]
6. *Is any information missing from individual instances? If so, please provide a description, explaining why this information is missing (for example, because it was unavailable). This does not include intentionally removed information, but might include, for example, redacted text.*
	- Column 'Quartile Range' is missing for non-By State group. Only rows with 'By State' group has Quartile Range information.
7. *Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (for example, users' movie ratings, social network links)? If so, please describe how these relationships are made explicit.*
	- The combination of Symptoms of Depressive Disorder and Symptoms of Anxiety Disorder are combined as Symptoms of Anxiety Disorder or Depressive Disorder. 
8. *Are there recommended data splits (for example, training, development/validation, testing)? If so, please provide a description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind them.*
	- No
9. *Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset? If so, please provide a description.*
	- Not shown so far.
10. *Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources (for example, websites, tweets, other datasets)? If it links to or relies on external resources, a) are there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over time; b) are there official archival versions of the complete dataset (that is, including the external resources as they existed at the time the dataset was created); c) are there any restrictions (for example, licenses, fees) associated with any of the external resources that might apply to a dataset consumer? Please provide descriptions of all external resources and any restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other access points, as appropriate.*
	- The dataset is self-contained.
11. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (for example, data that is protected by legal privilege or by doctor-patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals' non-public communications)? If so, please provide a description.*
	- No
12. *Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety? If so, please describe why.*
	- Dataset could have been labeled White as Caucasian, Black as African American. Also, they are excluding the minorities by grouping them all as 'Non-Hispanic, other races and multiple races.' For instance, South Asian Americans, Middle Eastern Americans, Native Americans. 
13. *Does the dataset identify any sub-populations (for example, by age, gender)? If so, please describe how these subpopulations are identified and provide a description of their respective distributions within the dataset.*
	- By age, 18 - 29 years, 30 - 39 years, 40 - 49 years, 50 - 59 years, 60 - 69 years, 70 - 79 years, and 80 years and above. By sex, there are male and female.
14. *Is it possible to identify individuals (that is, one or more natural persons), either directly or indirectly (that is, in combination with other data) from the dataset? If so, please describe how.*
	- No, each subgroup population is the accumulated, therefore it's hard to identify single individual.
15. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered sensitive in any way (for example, data that reveals race or ethnic origins, sexual orientations, religious beliefs, political opinions or union memberships, or locations; financial or health data; biometric or genetic data; forms of government identification, such as social security numbers; criminal history)? If so, please provide a description.*
	- The data reveals race, highest educational attainment, region (states), age.

**Collection process**

Was the data directly observable (for example, raw text, movie ratings), reported by subjects (for example, survey responses), or indirectly inferred/derived from other data (for example, part-of-speech tags, model-based guesses for age or language)?
