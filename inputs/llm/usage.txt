Under the <Group> column, only use rows with 'National Estimate' for  'Symptoms of Anxiety Disorder or Depressive Disorder',  'Symptoms of Depressive Disorder' and 'Symptoms of Anxiety Disorder' respectively under the <Indicator> column. 
Write me R scripts such that I have year on the x-axis and the rates on the y-axis. 
Accumulate year data from 'Time Period Label' and rates from 'Value' columns. I should have a figure of line graphs with three different lines representing 'Symptoms of Depressive Disorder', 'Symptoms of Anxiety Disorder', 'Symptoms of Anxiety Disorder or Depressive Disorder' respectively. Also for the year on the x-axis, I want to have 2020.05, 2020.09, 2021.01, 2021.05, 2021.09, 2022.01, 2022.05, 2022.09, 2023.01, 2023.05, 2023.09, 2024.01 marked down.

To create the R script that filters the data based on the 'Group' and 'Indicator' columns, accumulates data by year, and plots the rates of 'Symptoms of Anxiety Disorder', 'Symptoms of Depressive Disorder', and 'Symptoms of Anxiety Disorder or Depressive Disorder', follow these steps:

1. Load the necessary libraries.
2. Read the CSV file into a data frame.
3. Filter the data as required.
4. Extract the year and month from the 'Time Period Label' column to create a new 'YearMonth' column.
5. Aggregate the data by 'YearMonth' and 'Indicator'.
6. Plot the data with years on the x-axis and rates on the y-axis.

Here’s how the R script would look:

```r
# Load necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)

# Load the dataset
data <- read_csv("/mnt/data/Indicators_of_Anxiety_or_Depression_Based_on_Reported_Frequency_of_Symptoms_During_Last_7_Days_20240401.csv")

# Filter the dataset for 'National Estimate' under 'Group' column and select indicators of interest
filtered_data <- data %>%
  filter(Group == "National Estimate" & Indicator %in% c("Symptoms of Anxiety Disorder", 
                                                         "Symptoms of Depressive Disorder", 
                                                         "Symptoms of Anxiety Disorder or Depressive Disorder"))

# Create a YearMonth column from 'Time Period Label'
filtered_data <- filtered_data %>%
  mutate(YearMonth = as.Date(paste0(sub("^(\\d{4}).+", "\\1", `Time Period Label`), 
                                    ".", 
                                    sub(".+(\\d{2})$", "\\1", `Time Period Label`), 
                                    "01"), format="%Y.%m.%d"))

# Aggregate the data by YearMonth and Indicator
aggregated_data <- filtered_data %>%
  group_by(YearMonth, Indicator) %>%
  summarise(AverageValue = mean(Value, na.rm = TRUE))

# Plot the data
ggplot(aggregated_data, aes(x = YearMonth, y = AverageValue, color = Indicator)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "6 months", date_labels = "%Y.%m") +
  labs(
    title = "National Estimates of Mental Health Symptoms",
    subtitle = "Trends of Symptoms of Anxiety and Depressive Disorders",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Rate (%)",
    color = "Indicator"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

In this script:

- Data is filtered to include only rows where the 'Group' is 'National Estimate' and the 'Indicator' is one of the specified mental health symptoms.
- A 'YearMonth' column is created by extracting the year and month from the 'Time Period Label'.
- The data is then aggregated by 'YearMonth' and 'Indicator', calculating the mean 'Value'.
- Finally, a line graph is created with `ggplot`, showing the trend of each symptom type over time, with specified time points on the x-axis.

Make sure to adjust the path to the CSV file as needed and install the necessary R packages (`tidyverse` and `lubridate`) if they are not already installed.

I got this error "Error in loadNamespace(x) : there is no package called ‘here’" when I run the following code,

filtered_data <- data %>%
  filter(Group == "National Estimate" & Indicator %in% c("Symptoms of Anxiety Disorder", 
                                                         "Symptoms of Depressive Disorder",

The error "Error in loadNamespace(x) : there is no package called ‘here’" indicates that the R package `here` is not installed or not loaded correctly in your environment. The `here` package is used to construct platform-independent file paths, making it easier to reference files within a project.

To resolve this issue, you should first ensure that the `here` package is installed. You can install it using the `install.packages` function in R:

```r
install.packages("here")
```

After installing the package, you need to load it into your R session using the `library` function:

```r
library(here)
```

So, your code should include the `library(here)` statement after loading other libraries:

```r
# Load necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(here)  # Make sure this line is added

# Load the dataset
data <- read.csv(file = here("Anxiety_depressive_disorder/inputs/data/Anxiety_or_Depression.csv"))

# Filter the dataset for 'National Estimate' under 'Group' column and select indicators of interest
filtered_data <- data %>%
  filter(Group == "National Estimate" & Indicator %in% c("Symptoms of Anxiety Disorder", 
                                                         "Symptoms of Depressive Disorder", 
                                                         "Symptoms of Anxiety Disorder or Depressive Disorder"))

# Create a YearMonth column from 'Time Period Label'
filtered_data <- filtered_data %>%
  mutate(YearMonth = as.Date(paste0(sub("^(\\d{4}).+", "\\1", `Time Period Label`), 
                                    ".", 
                                    sub(".+(\\d{2})$", "\\1", `Time Period Label`), 
                                    "01"), format="%Y.%m.%d"))

# Aggregate the data by YearMonth and Indicator
aggregated_data <- filtered_data %>%
  group_by(YearMonth, Indicator) %>%
  summarise(AverageValue = mean(Value, na.rm = TRUE))

# Plot the data
ggplot(aggregated_data, aes(x = YearMonth, y = AverageValue, color = Indicator)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "6 months", date_labels = "%Y.%m") +
  labs(
    title = "National Estimates of Mental Health Symptoms",
    subtitle = "Trends of Symptoms of Anxiety and Depressive Disorders",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Rate (%)",
    color = "Indicator"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

Make sure to replace the path in the `here` function with the correct path to your CSV file. The `here` function constructs the path relative to the root of your R project directory, which makes your code more portable and easier to run in different environments.
